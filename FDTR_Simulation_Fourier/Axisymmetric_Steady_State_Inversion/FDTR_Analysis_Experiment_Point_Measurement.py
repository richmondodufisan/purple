# This code is for calculating thermal properties (thermal conductivity and interface conductance) from experimental data
# The code is for point measurements, and assumes that the necessary data points are in the same folder with the same file prefix,
# with a number at the end denoting which sample it is. The "num_files" variable denotes how many files to read.

# For some samples, higher frequencies enter the non-Fourier regime, and need to be removed before fitting. The "cutoff"
# variable within the "process_file" function is responsible for adjusting the number of points to cut off.

# Please see the documentation in Layered_Heat_Conduction to understand how material properties are passed to calc_thermal_response'
